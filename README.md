A <strong>Python</strong> script that generates a UI in <strong>Autodesk Maya</strong> to create city layouts. 
The generator features numerous parameters such as building shape, number of buildings, spacing, building sizes and many more, allowing them to 
generate all kinds of environments, including buildings, cities, rain, snow, grass, etc.
Tabs are created at each generation, allowing users to create and modify multiple different layouts at the same time.
Also includes a duplicator tool to create copies of generations, with many useful options.
